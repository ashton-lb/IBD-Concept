# IBD Concept

The IBD Concept is a theoretical and exploratory framework that investigates
decision-making in complex systems through classical mathematical optimization
and adaptive modeling.

Rather than proposing a concrete implementation, the project focuses on
conceptual structure, mathematical interpretability, and robustness under
uncertainty.

- **LaTeX source:** `paper/ibd_concept.tex`

## 🎯 Scope and Motivation

The core motivation of this work is to bridge:
- calculus-based optimization (gradients, marginal analysis)
- region-based optimality instead of point estimation
- adaptive adjustment without loss of mathematical transparency

This repository is intended as a foundation for academic discussion and
future undergraduate research development.

## 📌 Status

Preprint — conceptual work, open for discussion and future formal extension.
