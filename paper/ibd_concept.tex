\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the IBD (Integrated Bio-Digital) concept, a theoretical framework that integrates classical mathematical optimization with adaptive machine learning techniques to support decision-making in complex productive systems under uncertainty. The approach emphasizes interpretability, probabilistic optimal regions, and robustness to biological and environmental variability.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Decision-making in productive systems often relies on heuristics or static recommendations, despite the nonlinear and multivariate nature of the underlying processes. This work proposes a conceptual framework that combines calculus-based optimization with adaptive learning to address this gap.

\section{Mathematical Modeling}
Let the system output be defined as:
\[
y = f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, t) + \varepsilon
\]
where $x_i$ are controllable variables, $t$ represents time, and $\varepsilon$ captures stochastic variability.

\section{Optimization Framework}
Optimal regions are identified by analyzing first- and second-order derivatives of the response function. Rather than computing a single optimal point, the framework defines probabilistic optimal intervals.

\section{Adaptive Layer}
Machine learning techniques are introduced to dynamically adjust model parameters based on observed data, preserving the interpretability of the mathematical structure.

\section{Conclusion}
By integrating mathematical rigor with adaptive learning, the IBD framework offers a structured approach to decision-making under uncertainty.
